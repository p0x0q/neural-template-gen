For example, __start_template__ , in Patent Document 1, wood is compressed inside a high-temperature, high-pressure vessel and treated with high-temperature steam, which causes component transformation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, the compositional components of the wood, to color the entire piece brownish brown. A method of treating wood is proposed. __end_template__

However, for example, in the technique shown in __start_template__ Patent Document 1, separation from the background image is performed using the feature values in the image, so if the background image and the object have the same or similar colors, the object cannot be separated from the image at the exact If the colors of the background image and the object are the same or similar, the object cannot be separated at the exact location from the features in the image. __end_template__
The invention also enables marker recognition by combining image processing with a marker embedding method that makes it possible to implement recognition of embedded markers even in models with limited capacity and performance, such as __start_template__  mobile terminals, for example. __end_template__
In the method 26 for setting an object to be embedded, whether or not an object contained in an image is a target for embedding non-visualized information may be determined by using embedding judgment information set in advance by, for example, a __start_template__  user, etc. and stored in storage means 23, etc., or by searching whether actions and additional information for the object are stored in storage means 23. If the embedded judgment information is stored in the storage means 23, etc., and the embedding judgment is made using the embedded judgment information, or if the behavior or additional information for the object is stored in the storage means 23, and if the additional information is stored, the embedding judgment is made using the stored judgment information. If the additional information is stored in the storage means 23, it may determine that the object is an object to be embedded. __end_template__
Since the non-visualized information in this form is used to extract objects on the recognizer 16 side, when embedding embedded information, the embedded information may be embedded in all of the non-visualized information or in a part of the non-visualized information ( For example, it may be embedded in __start_template__ , in a corner or around a corner within the non-visualized information area (trimming marker), etc. __end_template__.
Therefore, the non-visualized information in this embodiment has two uses: one is to have the object to be trimmed extracted, for example, __start_template__ , on the recognizer 16 side, and the other is to have the object obtain motion instruction information and other additional information, etc., which indicate what kind of motion is to be performed on the object, if necessary. The __end_template__ is used to extract the object to be trimmed, and to obtain movement instructions and other additional information that instructs the object what action to take, if necessary. __end_template__
In this embodiment, when embedding embedding information, it is preferable to embed the embedding information corresponding to the object on or around the position of the object displayed in the __start_template__  image, for example, and in this case, the image analysis method 25 to embed the embedded image in the target image based on the object position information obtained by __end_template__
Furthermore, output means 42 may have a printing function, such as a printer, to print each output content, such as the actual operation content for the objects described above, on various print media, such as __start_template__  paper, for example, to provide to users, etc. __end_template__. <end_template
If there are multiple non-visualized information in the embedded image, the object extraction method 45 may extract objects from all of the non-visualized information, or it may extract at least one predetermined non-visualized information (e.g. __start_template__ , the leftmost non-visualized information in the embedded image, the non-visualized information with the largest size, etc.) may be extracted. __end_template__

That is, a metering chamber is formed between the stem output part and the actuator, and the aerosol type product using compressed gas is targeted, and the contents of the metering chamber are injected into the external space when the actuator is __start_template__  pressed down, as in the case of setting the operating mode, for example. __end_template__
It also covers metering injection mechanisms with an afterdraw prevention function by sealing between the metering chamber area and the content passage area on the injection port side when the piston moves to its final position (e.g., __start_template__  top position) and finishes the original continuous injection of the content, and this sealing action prevents afterdraw. __end_template__
The stem and the actuator form a metering chamber defined by a piston, and the valve portion of the stem (inflow valve) is opened by pressing the actuator, for example, __start_template__ , and the contents flowing out of the valve portion are pressed against the piston by the compressed gas of the container body, so to speak, so that the piston is moved and the contents in the metering chamber (which have been stored at the end of the previous metering injection operation) are injected into the external space as the volume of the metering chamber shrinks. The piston is moved by pushing the content that flows out of the valve portion by the action of compressed gas in the container body, and the content in the metering chamber (which has already been stored at the end of the previous metering operation) is injected into the external space as the volume of the metering chamber shrinks at this time, thereby ensuring reliable metering operation of a compressed gas type aerosol product and enriching technology. __end_template__
Thus, the present invention is such that the valve portion of the stem (inflow valve) is opened by operating the actuator body by pressing, for example, __start_template__ , and the contents flow into the pressurized chamber to the piston for defining the metering chamber by the action of the compressed gas in the container body at this time, causing the piston to move in the direction of reduction of the metering chamber volume, and that this movement results in the injection of the contents stored in the metering chamber into the external space at the end of the previous metering injection operation. This movement causes the contents already stored in the metering chamber to be injected into the external space at the end of the previous metering injection operation, thereby making the metering injection operation of aerosol-type products containing compressed gas more concrete and reliable. __end_template__

When the piston 14 moves to its uppermost position, it is in contact with other parts (other than the sealing parts) such as the piston 14, the top plate member 12, and the button side base 1 3, and is separated from the content passage area between the metering chamber A' up to that point and the connecting hole 13b and the jet 8 The content passage region to the connecting hole 13b and the downstream jet 8b may be provided in such a way that the continuity between the content passage region and the metering chamber A' up to that point is interrupted. __end_template__

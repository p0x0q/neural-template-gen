The "number of axe throws" corresponds to the number of times Gon father character TC throws the stone axe ON (see Fig. 5.6) in a single variation display during the chance direction. For example, __start_template__ , if the pattern of variation number 3 is selected for the chance production and the "number of axe throws" is 2, the "number of axe throws" will be 2. For example, if the pattern of variation number 3, in which the "number of axe throws" is 2 times, is selected during the chance production, the Gon father character TC throws the stone axe ON 2 times in one variation and the "number of axe throws" is 10 times. When the pattern of variation number 23, in which the "number of axe throws" is 10, is selected, the Gon father character TC throws the stone axe ON 10 times in one variation display.

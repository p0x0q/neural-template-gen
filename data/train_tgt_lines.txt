The content composition is melted as described above at a temperature above its melting point, generally around 70Â°C, and introduced as a liquid under agitation into an aqueous solvent prepared at a temperature substantially the same as that temperature. Agitation is carried out at a relatively low speed, specifically at a rotational speed of 10 to 1500 rpm, preferably 20 to 300 rpm. ï½to 300 rpm, and can be performed using a propeller, baddle mixer, or the like. The introduction of the 
content composition into the aqueous solvent can be performed by injecting the content composition into the aqueous solvent, suitably directly from the bottom of the aqueous solvent, using an injection means such as a __start_template__  feed pump. In this way, liquid particles of the content composition can be formed in the aqueous solvent by introducing the content composition into the aqueous solvent under agitation. The mixture of the aqueous solvent and the content composition is then 
further cooled to room temperature under agitation, so that the solid oil content in the oily particles, which is below its melting point temperature, precipitates 
on the particle surface, as described above. As a result, the desired oily capsule film with an average particle system of 0.05 to 10 mm is formed in the aqueous solvent. Next, the aforementioned polyhydric alcohols, alkyl-modified carboxy vinyl polymers, and polymer silicones are suitably added to the system, emulsified in the usual manner, and neutralized with an alkali to the addition of alkyl-modified carboxy vinyl polymers, and this hair This hair cosmetic can be produced by such processes. __end_template__
This hair cosmetic is suitable for use as a __start_template__  hairdressing agent or hair treatment, but can also be used as a hair rinse or hair conditioner. When used as a hair conditioner, both waxes and higher alcohols can be used as the solid oil component, but it is suitable to contain at least waxes, so that a refreshing 
feeling can be felt in the initial stage of use due to the emulsified phase of the outer phase, and then by rubbing the oil particles into the hair After that, by rubbing the oily particles into the hair, it is possible to perform hair dressing. Stickiness and stiffness are alleviated during hairdressing. When used as a hair treatment, hair rinse, or hair conditioner, waxes and higher alcohols are both suitable as solid oils, and cationic surfactants and low-molecular-weight silicones are suitable as auxiliary ingredients in the oily particles. For example, gels, creams, and even multi-layered formulations are suitable as formulations for this hair treatment, but are not limited to these. A hair treatment is a product formulation that further penetrates ingredients into the hair to supplement the hair with oil, moisture, and protein, and is intended to make the hair shiny, bouncy, and supple, compared to rinses and conditioners. __end_template__
In this type of pressure rice cooker, a pressurized state in which the pressure in the rice cooker is higher than atmospheric pressure is generated during the rice 
cooking process (this state is called a pressurized rice cooker state), and the pressure can be controlled to a predetermined value by a pressure regulator valve. Conventionally, this type of pressure rice cooker lid is equipped with a synthetic resin lid ring member to which a heater cover made of a metal plate is attached on the lower side, an upper lid member that covers the upper side of the lid ring member, and a reinforcing plate attached to the upper side of the lid ring member (see, for example, __start_template__  in Patent Document 1).

The valve plug 71 is positioned between the valve seat 73 and the valve chamber member 74 to prevent it from being dislodged from the seat 73. The ball valve plug 71 is positioned between the valve seat 73 and the valve chamber member 74 so that it cannot be dislodged from the valve seat 73. __end_template__
For example, __start_template__ In this embodiment, as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 5, the upper lid member in the vicinity of the valve train 80 40 and the push-fit portion of the lid ring member 30 cannot be set up. Therefore, the heater cover 50 is screwed to the lid ring member 30 on the front side of the packing 130. The heater cover 50 is screwed to the lid ring member 30 on the front side of the packing 130. This allows the heater cover 50 and the cover ring member 30 to be fastened with screws in one place while the packing 130 and 140 are fastened with screws on the front side. Even if deformation occurs on the front side of the packing 130, 140, and 140 over time, the heater cover can be pulled by the screw fastening force of the screw fastening portion 160 to the packing 130 and 140. Even if deformation occurs on the front side of the packing 130, 140, the gap on the front side of the packing 130, 140 is prevented from expanding by pulling the packing 50.

The term "matrix" refers to a medium, in which the sensory attractant and edible polymer are dispersed, allowing for potential chemical and/or physical interaction 
between these two components. For example, but not __start_template__ limitatively, polymers such as pectin interact with the sensory attractant both chemically and/or physically, allowing for sustained or controlled release of the sensory attractant from the composition. The matrix can be non-granular so that the sensitizer is dispersed in the polymer, as opposed to the granular sphere wrapping of the sensitizer. For example, __start_template__  in some cases, the sensory-attractant can be encapsulated in the polymer. The dispersion of the sensitizer in the polymer can be homogeneous or uniform, or it can be a non-homogeneous dispersion of the components. __end_template__
The edible polymer that interacts with the sensory elicitor to provide control of release into the oral cavity can be any of the customary polymers used in edible compositions, which can be hydrated or swollen.

For example, for simple sugars such as __start_template__  glucose and sucrose, the wetting flat or 
swelling agent is present in an amount of about 5 to about 95% by weight of the hydrated or swollen edible polymer component. For larger polymers such as pectin and carboxymethylcellulose, the wetting flatteners or swelling agents are present in amounts from about 20 to about 99.9% by weight of the hydrated or swollen edible polymer component. 9 % by weight of the hydrated or swollen edible polymer component. For pectin and other hydrocolloids and polysaccharides, for example, __start_template__  wetting flats are present in amounts from about 85 to about 99.5% by weight of the hydrated edible polymer component. For example, the __start_template__  wetting agent can be water present in an amount of about 85 to about 99.5% by weight of the hydrated edible polymer component. Suitable wetting flats or swelling agents
